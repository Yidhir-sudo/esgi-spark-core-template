# Spark Core Scala Application Template

This repository provides a template for building and deploying a Spark Core application using Scala. It is designed to help you get started with distributed data processing using Apache Spark and Scala, offering a simple yet flexible foundation for your Spark-based applications.

## Features

- **Apache Spark Core**: Uses Apache Spark Core for distributed data processing.
- **Scala**: Written in Scala, a powerful functional and object-oriented language.
- **Simple Example**: Includes a simple example of working with RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) and DataFrames.
- **Cluster Compatibility**: Supports easy deployment to Spark clusters.
- **Build System**: Built using [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) for dependency management and project builds.

## Prerequisites

To use this template, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- **Java 8 or higher**
- **Apache Spark** (v3.x recommended)
- **Scala** (v2.12 or higher)
- **sbt** for Scala project builds and dependency management

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spark-core-scala-template.git
cd spark-core-scala-template
```
### 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses sbt for dependency management. To install all required dependencies, run:

```bash
sbt update
```

### 3. Build the Project
To build the project and package it into a JAR file, run:

```bash
sbt package
```

This will generate the JAR file in the target/scala-2.x.x directory.

## Running the Application

To run the application locally, you can use the following command with sbt:

```bash
sbt run
```

To submit the application to a Spark cluster, use the spark-submit command as follows:

```bash
spark-submit --class com.example.Main --master <master-url> target/scala-2.x.x/spark-core-scala-template-assembly-1.0.jar
```

Replace <master-url> with the URL of your Spark cluster (e.g., local[*] for local mode).
